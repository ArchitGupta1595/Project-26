To make vanilla ice cream at home, you will need:

2 1/2 cups half and half
8 egg yolks
1 cup sugar
 2 1/2 cups heavy cream
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
Before you begin, make sure your ice cream maker insert is frozen ahead of time! It needs to be completely chilled, so freeze overnight if you can.
